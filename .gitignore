## Environment normalization:
/rails/.bundle
/rails/vendor/bundle

# these should all be checked in to normalize the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
/rails/.rvmrc

# if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
/rails/vendor/assets/bower_components
/rails/*.bowerrc
/rails/bower.json

# Ignore pow environment settings
/rails/.powenv

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
/rails/.byebug_history
