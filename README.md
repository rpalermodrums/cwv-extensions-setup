# Setup

## Docker and Docker-compose:

You should install [Docker for mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) which includes docker-compose to get started.
This will be the easiest way to run the app locally. 

## Commands:

To build the container (run the app):

`docker-compose up --build`

To stop the container (stop the app):

`docker-compose down`
